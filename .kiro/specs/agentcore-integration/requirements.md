# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Amazon Bedrock AgentCore services into the PropertyPilot multi-agent real estate investment system. The integration will enhance the existing Property Scout, Market Analyzer, Deal Evaluator, and Investment Manager agents with enterprise-grade runtime, memory, observability, and built-in tools capabilities provided by AgentCore.

## Glossary

- **PropertyPilot_System**: The existing multi-agent real estate investment analysis platform
- **AgentCore_Runtime**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore serverless runtime for deploying and scaling agents
- **AgentCore_Memory**: Memory service providing short-term and long-term memory capabilities for agents
- **AgentCore_Observability**: Monitoring and tracing service for agent performance and debugging
- **AgentCore_Code_Interpreter**: Secure code execution environment for data analysis tasks
- **AgentCore_Browser**: Cloud-based browser runtime for web interaction capabilities
- **Property_Scout_Agent**: Agent responsible for property discovery and data collection
- **Market_Analyzer_Agent**: Agent handling market research and valuation analysis
- **Deal_Evaluator_Agent**: Agent performing financial analysis and ROI calculations
- **Investment_Manager_Agent**: Orchestration agent managing multi-agent workflows
- **Session_Context**: Isolated execution environment maintaining user conversation state
- **Memory_Records**: Persistent data stored across agent sessions for context awareness

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot user, I want my agents to run on enterprise-grade infrastructure, so that I can rely on consistent performance and security for my real estate investment analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PropertyPilot_System deploys agents, THE AgentCore_Runtime SHALL host all four agent types with serverless scaling
2. THE AgentCore_Runtime SHALL provide session isolation for each user interaction
3. THE AgentCore_Runtime SHALL support multi-modal payloads for property images and documents
4. THE AgentCore_Runtime SHALL maintain fast cold start times under 2 seconds for agent initialization
5. WHERE high availability is required, THE AgentCore_Runtime SHALL provide 99.9% uptime for agent services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot user, I want my agents to remember previous conversations and property analyses, so that I can build upon past research without repeating work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with any PropertyPilot agent, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL store conversation context in short-term memory
2. WHEN Property_Scout_Agent discovers properties, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL persist property data in long-term memory for cross-session access
3. WHEN Market_Analyzer_Agent completes market research, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL save market insights for future reference
4. THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL enable Deal_Evaluator_Agent to access historical property analyses for comparison
5. THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL allow Investment_Manager_Agent to retrieve portfolio context across multiple sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot developer, I want comprehensive observability into agent performance, so that I can monitor, debug, and optimize the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any PropertyPilot agent executes, THE AgentCore_Observability SHALL capture execution traces with timing data
2. THE AgentCore_Observability SHALL provide real-time metrics for token usage, latency, and error rates
3. THE AgentCore_Observability SHALL integrate with CloudWatch for centralized logging and monitoring
4. WHEN agent errors occur, THE AgentCore_Observability SHALL provide detailed error context and stack traces
5. THE AgentCore_Observability SHALL enable performance analysis across all four agent types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot user, I want agents to perform complex financial calculations and data analysis, so that I can get accurate investment insights with detailed computations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Deal_Evaluator_Agent needs to perform ROI calculations, THE AgentCore_Code_Interpreter SHALL execute Python code in isolated environments
2. THE AgentCore_Code_Interpreter SHALL provide access to financial libraries like pandas and numpy for data analysis
3. WHEN Market_Analyzer_Agent processes demographic data, THE AgentCore_Code_Interpreter SHALL handle data visualization and statistical analysis
4. THE AgentCore_Code_Interpreter SHALL maintain session persistence for multi-step calculations
5. THE AgentCore_Code_Interpreter SHALL ensure secure execution with no cross-session data leakage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot user, I want agents to interact with real estate websites and gather current market data, so that my analysis is based on the most up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Property_Scout_Agent needs to gather property listings, THE AgentCore_Browser SHALL provide web automation capabilities
2. THE AgentCore_Browser SHALL enable interaction with Zillow, Realtor.com, and MLS websites
3. WHEN Market_Analyzer_Agent researches market trends, THE AgentCore_Browser SHALL capture screenshots and extract data from web pages
4. THE AgentCore_Browser SHALL provide enterprise-grade security for web interactions
5. THE AgentCore_Browser SHALL scale automatically based on concurrent web scraping demands

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a PropertyPilot system administrator, I want seamless migration from the current deployment to AgentCore, so that existing functionality continues to work while gaining new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PropertyPilot_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing Strands Agents framework integration
2. WHEN migrating to AgentCore_Runtime, THE PropertyPilot_System SHALL preserve all existing agent tool definitions and capabilities
3. THE PropertyPilot_System SHALL maintain existing API endpoints while adding AgentCore-enhanced features
4. THE PropertyPilot_System SHALL support gradual migration with ability to run both deployment modes during transition
5. WHERE configuration changes are needed, THE PropertyPilot_System SHALL provide clear migration documentation and scripts
